# News Bot — Standards of Evaluation

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive evaluation framework and methodologies used to assess the News Bot system's performance, quality, and effectiveness. The standards defined here serve as the foundation for all testing, measurement, and quality assurance processes throughout the project lifecycle.

## Purpose

The Standards of Evaluation documentation aims to:

1. Establish clear, quantifiable metrics for measuring system performance
2. Define reproducible methodologies for consistent evaluation
3. Set quality benchmarks and acceptance criteria for releases
4. Outline quality assurance processes to ensure evaluation validity
5. Document planned improvements to the evaluation framework

## Document Guide

### [Evaluation Framework](evaluation_framework.md)

The foundational document that defines **how every News Bot release is measured, compared, and accepted**. It establishes:

- Design principles guiding the evaluation approach
- Core metrics across multiple dimensions (utility, factual integrity, efficiency, etc.)
- Scoring system and acceptance gates for releases
- Evaluation datasets and cadence

This document should be consulted first to understand the overall evaluation philosophy and structure.

### [Evaluation Methodologies](evaluation_methodologies.md)

Details the specific methodologies used to evaluate News Bot releases, focusing on:

- The methodology portfolio (Replay Harness, Expert Micro-Review, etc.)
- Implementation details for each methodology
- Procedural steps for conducting evaluations
- Limitations and mitigations

This document explains *how* the metrics defined in the framework are collected and analyzed.

### [Target Metrics & Benchmark Structure](metrics_and_benchmarks.md)

Defines the specific targets and benchmarks for all metrics, including:

- Tier map organizing metrics by importance
- Detailed definitions for each metric
- Target values and collection methods
- Historical changes to metrics and benchmarks

Refer to this document for the current performance expectations and how metrics are categorized by priority.

### [Quality Assurance for Evaluation](quality_assurance.md)

Outlines the processes that ensure the validity and reliability of evaluation results:

- Guiding principles for quality assurance
- Process checklists for different evaluation stages
- Test-case governance and human evaluation protocols
- QA health metrics and role allocation

This document ensures that the evaluation process itself meets high standards of quality.

### [Development Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)

Documents planned enhancements to the News Bot system, with a focus on evaluation and quality assurance improvements:

- Upcoming features and improvements
- Rationale and planned approach for each enhancement
- Dependencies and target timelines
- Implementation plans for new metrics and methodologies

Consult this document to understand future directions for the evaluation framework.

## How These Documents Work Together

The documents in this section form an interconnected system:

1. The **Evaluation Framework** establishes the foundation and principles
2. **Evaluation Methodologies** detail how to implement the framework
3. **Target Metrics & Benchmarks** set specific goals based on the framework
4. **Quality Assurance** ensures the integrity of the evaluation process
5. The **Roadmap** outlines how the evaluation system will evolve

When implementing or reviewing evaluations, start with the Framework to understand the overall approach, then consult the Methodologies for implementation details, and refer to the Metrics & Benchmarks for specific targets.

## Current Status and Limitations

> **Important Note:** Some elements in these documents might have been placed in anticipation of future outputs, contributors, or changes, and thus might not be fully implemented yet. Elements marked with footnotes or explicitly labeled as "planned" or "future" represent aspirational components that are documented for completeness but may not be currently operational.

For the most accurate representation of current performance, please refer to the version-specific Analysis Reports in the [05_Analysis/](../05_Analysis/) directory.

## Contributing to These Standards

The evaluation standards are designed to evolve as the News Bot system matures. When proposing changes:

1. Ensure changes align with the core design principles in the Evaluation Framework
2. Document the rationale for any metric additions or modifications
3. Update all relevant documents to maintain consistency
4. Add entries to change logs where applicable
5. Consider backward compatibility for historical comparisons
