## INSTRUCTIONS

Your task is to categorize news items for high net-worth individuals with limited time. You need to **analyze and categorize each news item** to help prioritize the most relevant and important information.

### CATEGORIZATION APPROACH
As the recipient's dedicated News Curator, you must:
1. **Analyze each news item** for its topic, importance, and relevance to the recipient's interests and profession.
2. **Assign a primary category** to each news item (e.g., Technology, Finance, Politics, Science, etc.).
3. **Rate the importance** of each news item on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is extremely important.
4. **Rate the relevance** to the recipient's interests and profession on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is extremely relevant.
5. **Provide a brief explanation** of why the news item is important or relevant to the recipient.

### OUTPUT FORMAT
For each news item, provide the following information in JSON format:

{
  "headline": "Original headline",
  "category": "Primary category",
  "importance": 1-5,
  "relevance": 1-5,
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of importance/relevance"
}

Ensure your categorization is tailored to the recipient's profession and interests. Focus on providing accurate and helpful categorizations that will allow the recipient to quickly identify the most important and relevant news items.

## Version H2.7.3: Advanced Implementation

### Categorizer Interaction 

### Prompt

```text

Output a JSON array containing objects—no explanations, no table formats, no column headers.
CRITICAL: Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']' to be valid JSON.
CRITICAL: Every object must be wrapped with '{{' and '}}' and properly nested in the array.

Task: For each headline, include an object with these exact fields:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "category": "Technology",
    "importance": 4,
    "relevance": 3,
    "why": "This impacts core AI infrastructure development"
  },
  {

    "category": "Science",
    "importance": 3.5,
    "relevance": 4.2,
    "why": "New research relevant to quantum computing"
  }
]
Scoring schema:
• importance: 1 trivial ↔ 5 systemic; multiply raw impact by e^(-age_days/5).
• relevance: 1 tangential ↔ 5 directly affects {interests}.
Allowed categories: Technology | Science | Defence | Politics | Markets | Other


CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON array.
2. The array should start with '[' and end with ']'.
3. Each element in the array must be a valid JSON object, starting with '{{' and ending with '}}'.
4. Use only double quotes (") for all keys and string values within the JSON.
5. Do not include any explanations, comments, or any text outside of this JSON array structure.
6. Ensure no trailing commas in objects or arrays.

Example of a correctly formatted JSON array response (structure varies by agent task):

**Note on Output Format**: While H2.7.3's prompt explicitly requested a JSON array starting with `[`, the model wrapped it in `{"results": [...]}`. This top-level format compliance remains an active refinement area across the system, though the internal array structure and data quality improved significantly.

For detailed performance metrics and further analysis of H2.7.3, including format compliance across all agents, please refer to the [comprehensive analysis](../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.2.7.3/analysis.md).

## Analysis of Key Differences

The evolution from H.1 to H2.7.3 demonstrates significant improvements in the Categorizer Agent's capabilities through strategic prompt engineering. This section analyzes the key differences and their impact on performance metrics.

### Prompt Engineering Improvements

1. **Structural Changes**:
   - **H.1**: Comprehensive prompt with detailed recipient profiles, persona guidance, and basic categorization instructions
   - **H2.7.3**: Focused, modular design with explicit formatting requirements and few-shot examples

2. **Instruction Refinement**:
   - **H.1**: Simple 1-5 integer scoring system with minimal guidance
   - **H2.7.3**: Sophisticated scoring schema with descriptive anchors and a time-decay formula (`importance: 1 trivial ↔ 5 systemic; multiply raw impact by e^(-age_days/5)`)

3. **Output Format**:
   - **H.1**: Basic JSON structure with minimal formatting guidance
   - **H2.7.3**: Strict JSON formatting requirements with explicit error prevention instructions

4. **Categorization Approach**:
   - **H.1**: Open-ended category assignment
   - **H2.7.3**: Standardized category list (`Allowed categories: Technology | Science | Defence | Politics | Markets | Other`)

### Performance Metrics Comparison

| Metric | H.1 | H2.7.3 | Change | Impact                                    |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| Prompt Tokens | 1,304 | 1,582 | +21.3% | Increased due to richer instructions      |
| Completion Tokens | 830 | 409 | -50.7% | Significant reduction in output verbosity |
| Total Tokens | 2,134 | 1,991 | -6.7% | Overall token efficiency improvement      |
| Execution Time | 13.63s | 12.04s | -11.7% | Modest improvement in processing speed    |
| Model | gpt-4o-mini | gpt-4o | Upgrade | Increase in capability and reliability    |

> **Note**: Prompt grew 278 tokens, but forcing terse float output cut completion by 421, yielding a net 143-token drop.

### Alignment with Evaluation Framework

These improvements directly address key metrics in our [Evaluation Framework](../../02_Standards_Of_Evaluation/evaluation_framework.md):

1. **Efficiency (P3: Resource-aware)**:
   - Reduced total tokens aligns with the Tok/brief metric (Tier 1 target: ≤ 7,000)
   - Improved execution time contributes to the p95 Latency metric (Tier 1 target: ≤ 30s)

2. **Utility (P5: Single North-Star)**:
   - More precise categorization and relevance scoring enhances the Actionable Insight Rate (AIR) metric (Tier 0 target: ≥ 0.25)
   - Standardized categories and improved scoring improve the Relevance@3 metric (Tier 2 target: ≥ 4.0)

3. **Format Compliance**:
   - Explicit JSON formatting requirements reduce Schema Errors (Tier 3 target: = 0)
   - Standardized categories enhance consistency across outputs

### Qualitative Improvements

Beyond the quantitative metrics, the H2.7.3 version demonstrates several qualitative improvements:

1. **Scoring Precision**: Float-based scoring (e.g., 3.8, 4.5) versus integer-only scores in H.1
2. **Time-Sensitivity**: Incorporation of content age into importance calculations
3. **Standardization**: Consistent category taxonomy across all outputs
4. **Reasoning Transparency**: More explicit "why" explanations for categorizations

These adjustments transformed the Categorizer Agent from a basic classification tool to a sophisticated analytical component that provides more precise, consistent, and actionable categorizations.Thus, contributing directly to the overall effectiveness of the system in delivering personalized news intelligence.
