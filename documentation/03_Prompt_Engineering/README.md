### Agent Specifications (Work in Progress)

The [03.1_agents directory](03.1_agents/) currently contains specifications for three core agents:

1. [Categorizer Agent](03.1_agents/categorizer_agent.md): Classifies news items by topic and relevance
2. [Fact Checker Agent](03.1_agents/fact_checker.md): Verifies accuracy and credibility of news items
3. [Summarizer Agent](03.1_agents/summarizer_agent.md): Creates personalized news briefings

*Note: Additional agent specifications will be added to 03.1_agents in the future. The complete agent behaviors and outputs can be explored through the comprehensive examples in sections 03.2, 05, and 06.*

## Why These Components?
