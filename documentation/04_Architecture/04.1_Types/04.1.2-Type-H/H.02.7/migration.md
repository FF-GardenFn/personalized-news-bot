# Migration Plan: H.02.7 → H.02.7.3

This document outlines the migration plan from Version H.02.7 to Version H.02.7.3. This plan is informed by the findings in the **[Version H.02.7 Analysis Report](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.02.7/analysis.md)** and the summary in the **[Version H.02.7 Migration Retrospective](./README.md)**.

## 1. Executive Summary of Plan for H.02.7.3

H.02.7.3 aims to address the critical JSON formatting issues and pipeline integrity problems identified in H.02.7 while preserving its successful personalization capabilities. The plan focuses on implementing robust JSON handling mechanisms, strengthening pipeline integrity with proper validation and error handling, optimizing resource usage for better efficiency, and introducing new specialized agents (Linkage, ArXivSearcher) and a redesigned final summarizer (SummarizerLogic).

## 2. H.02.7 Current State Assessment (Summary from Analysis)

Type-H.02.7 represented an ambitious expansion toward a comprehensive agent swarm with enhanced function-calling capabilities. However, implementation revealed critical systemic challenges:

- **JSON Format Inconsistency**: Systematic failures in output format adherence across multiple agents
  - Using curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets `[]` for array structures
  - Malformed object keys containing escaped quotes and nested JSON
  - Inconsistent object formatting creating invalid structures

- **Pipeline Integrity Compromise**: Unreliable data flow and high parsing failure rates between agents
  - Dependency chains broke down when upstream agents failed
  - Outputs from upstream agents often failed to reach downstream components
  - Default/error values propagated through the system

- **Fiction Generation Risk**: The system generated convincing briefings from empty inputs
  - Non-existent GitHub repositories ("Quantum-AI-Projects")
  - Market recommendations without data
  - Research suggestions for fictional papers
  - Authoritative-sounding technical advice with no basis

- **Complex Multi-Agent Architecture Coordination Failure**: The expanded agent swarm introduced significant coordination challenges
  - State management became increasingly difficult with more agents
  - Error propagation amplified through the system rather than being contained

## 3. Migration Rationale & Objectives for Version H.02.7.3

The migration to H.02.7.3 is needed to address the fundamental issues identified in H.02.7:

- **Objective 1:** Eliminate JSON formatting errors that plagued H.02.7
