# Migration Plan: H.02.7.3 â†’ *Next Version*

> **Work in Progress**  
> This document draws on the H.02.7.3 analysis.  
> Detailed objectives, scope, and implementation strategy for *Next Version* are still being finalized.  
> Please check back for updates.

This document outlines the migration plan from Version H.02.7.3 to the next version. This plan is informed by the findings in the **[Version H.02.7.3 Analysis Report](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.02.7.3/analysis.md)** and the summary in the **[Version H.02.7.3 Migration Retrospective](./README.md)**.

## 1. Executive Summary of Plan for [Next Version]

[This section will be completed once the specific plans for the next version are determined based on H.02.7.3's analysis.]

## 2. H.02.7.3 Current State Assessment (Summary from Analysis)

H.02.7.3 represented a significant architectural evolution with new specialized agents (Linkage, ArXivSearcher) and a redesigned final summarizer (SummarizerLogic). However, it exhibited critical issues with JSON format adherence from multiple key agents, leading to severe pipeline breakages and preventing the full realization of the multi-agent system's potential.

Key limitations identified:
- **JSON Format Compliance:** 4/7 agents failed to produce valid JSON arrays despite explicit instructions
- **Pipeline Integrity Collapse:** JSON failures created a cascade of pipeline breakages
- **Resource Efficiency Crisis:** 2-2.5x the token target, 1.8-2.5x the latency target, 2-2.7x the cost target
- **FactChecker Anomaly:** 5,273 tokens to process just 1/10 items (21x per-item resource explosion)

Despite these challenges, three agents demonstrated proper functioning:
- **Synthesizer:** Format compliance and resilience despite receiving degraded inputs
- **Linkage:** Created relevant connections despite degraded inputs
- **SummarizerLogic:** Produced coherent briefings despite receiving no structured inputs
