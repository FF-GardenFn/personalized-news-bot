# Migration Plan: H.02.5 → H.02.7

This document outlines the migration plan from Version H.02.5 to Version H.02.7. This plan is informed by the findings in the **[Version H.02.5 Analysis Report](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.02.5/analysis.md)** and the summary in the **[Version H.02.5 Migration Retrospective](./README.md)**.

## 1. Executive Summary of Plan for H.02.7

H.02.7 aims to address the critical pipeline integrity issues identified in H.02.5 while significantly expanding analytical capabilities through a full agent swarm architecture and function-calling capabilities. The plan focuses on fixing JSON formatting issues, improving data flow between agents, unifying orchestration, deepening external data integration, and expanding analytical capabilities with specialized agents.

## 2. H.02.5 Current State Assessment (Summary from Analysis)

While Type-H.02.5 introduced significant analytical enhancements like market data integration, it faced several critical challenges:

- **Pipeline Integrity Issues**: Severe upstream data processing failures severely limited the system's potential
  - All items defaulted to "Uncategorized" with importance/relevance 3.0
  - All items defaulted to 0.7 credibility with "Auto-generated due to error"
  - Synthesis & Linkage produced "Auto-generated due to error" placeholders
  - Datetime parsing errors affected importance calculations

- **JSON Formatting & Validation**: Persistent issues despite multi-layered defenses
  - Upstream agents produced unparsable JSON
  - Even enhanced error handling couldn't salvage the outputs

- **Data Flow Problems**: Failure to pass structured data between agents
  - Analytical insights not properly passed to downstream agents
  - Personalization variables like "{recipient_short}" not replaced

- **Zombie Pipeline Problem**: Catastrophic failures producing seemingly successful outputs
  - End users receive professional-looking briefings generated from entirely synthetic data
  - This is worse than visible failure - it's invisible degradation

## 3. Migration Rationale & Objectives for Version H.02.7

The migration to H.02.7 is needed to address the fundamental issues identified in H.02.5:

- **Objective 1:** Fix pipeline integrity by addressing severe upstream agent failures
