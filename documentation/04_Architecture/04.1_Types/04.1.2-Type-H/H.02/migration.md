# Migration Plan: H.02 → H.02.5

This document outlines the migration plan from Version H.02 to Version H.02.5. This plan is informed by the findings in the **[Version H.02 Analysis Report](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.02/analysis.md)** and the summary in the **[Version H.02 Migration Retrospective](./README.md)**.

## 1. Executive Summary of Plan for H.02.5

H.02.5 aims to address the critical functional bugs and limitations identified in H.02 while enhancing analytical capabilities through market data integration and specialized agents. The plan focuses on fixing datetime handling, pipeline integration, personalization, and restoring analysis nuance, while also introducing new features to improve financial context and enhance JSON processing.

## 2. H.02 Current State Assessment (Summary from Analysis)

While Type-H.02 introduced significant improvements over H.01, it still faced several challenges:

- **Critical Functional Bugs**:
  - **Datetime Error**: Importance score calculation was compromised, leading to unreliable importance scores
  - **Pipeline Integration**: Synthesis insights were not properly passed to the Summarizer
  - **Personalization Failure**: Placeholder "{recipient_short}" was not replaced in the final output
  - **Sorting Logic**: Items were not correctly ordered by adjusted_score due to the datetime error

- **Reduced Analysis Nuance**:
  - **FactChecker Regression**: All "concerns" lists were empty, unlike H.01 which identified potential biases
  - **Taxonomy Inconsistency**: Category names differed between Categorizer and Summarizer
  - **Limited Analytical Depth**: Lacked specialized analysis for cross-source verification and market context

- **Performance Issues**:
  - **Latency**: Still exceeded the 30s target (31.34s for Persona 1, 36.20s for Persona 3)
  - **Token Usage**: Slightly exceeded the 7,000 token target (7,441 for Persona 1, 7,619 for Persona 3)

## 3. Migration Rationale & Objectives for Version H.02.5

The migration to H.02.5 is needed to address the fundamental issues identified in H.02:

- **Objective 1:** Fix critical functional bugs (datetime handling, pipeline integration, personalization)
- **Objective 2:** Restore analysis nuance lost in the transition from H.01 to H.02
- **Objective 3:** Enhance analytical capabilities with specialized agents and market data
- **Objective 4:** Further harden JSON processing to address persistent formatting issues
- **Objective 5:** Optimize performance to meet latency and token usage targets
- **Objective 6:** Experiment with alternative orchestration models for improved agent coordination
- **Objective 7:** Balance efficiency improvements with maintaining high-quality outputs

## 4. Proposed Architectural & Key Implementation Changes for Version H.02.5

### 3. Enhanced JSON Handling
- Implement more aggressive checks for known "problematic fragments" in LLM outputs
- Add pattern recognition for common JSON malformation issues
- Improve fallback mechanisms to ensure pipeline continuity despite errors

- **Pipeline Integration**: Fix data flow to ensure Synthesis insights are properly passed to Summarizer
- **Personalization**: Implement a structured persona object available to all agents
- **Sorting Logic**: Correct the adjusted_score calculation and sorting algorithm

### 6. Analysis Nuance Restoration
- **FactChecker Enhancement**: Improve prompt structure to elicit nuanced "concerns"
- **Taxonomy Standardization**: Implement consistent category naming across agents
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Add more sophisticated reasoning guidance and few-shot examples

### 7. Performance Optimization
