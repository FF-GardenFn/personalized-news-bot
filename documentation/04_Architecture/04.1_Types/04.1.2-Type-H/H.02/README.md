# Migration Retrospective: Achieving Version H.02

This document summarizes the migration from Version H.01 to Version H.02.
The primary goals for Version H.02 were set in the [Migration Plan for Version H.02 (located in ../H.01/migration.md)](../H.01/migration.md).

## Version H.02 Key Outcomes & Performance
- **Overall Verdict:** REJECT
- **Performance vs. Targets (from H.01's Plan for H.02):**
    - p95 Latency: 31-36s vs. ≤30s target - HARD FAIL
    - Tok/brief: 7,441-7,619 tokens vs. ≤7,000 target - HARD FAIL
    - Cost/brief: $0.002 vs. ≤$0.05 target - PASS (96% under budget)
    - Key Functional Goal: Fix Summarizer bug - INCOMPLETE (70% coverage vs. 100% target)
    - Other Key Success Criteria: Pipeline reliability - FAIL (Synthesis→Summarizer broken)
- For full details, see the **[Version H.02 Analysis Report](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.02/analysis.md)**.

## Major Successes in Iteration H.02
- **Cost Optimization:** 96% reduction achieved through model selection
- **Parallel Processing:** Reduced some latency bottlenecks
- **Shared Prompts:** Eliminated redundancy effectively
- **New Synthesis Capability:** Added cross-headline pattern identification
- **Format Compliance:** Good adherence to specified JSON formats

## Critical Failures & Regressions in Iteration H.02
- **Datetime Error:** Importance score calculation severely compromised, affecting downstream sorting
- **Pipeline Integrity:** Synthesis insights not passed to Summarizer
- **Personalization Failure:** Placeholder "{recipient_short}" not replaced, breaking personalization
- **FactChecker Nuance Loss:** Absence of "concerns" marks significant regression from H.01's analytical depth
- **Remaining Efficiency Targets:** Still missing Tier 0 p95 Latency and Tier 1 Tok/brief Hard Fail targets

## Key Lessons Learned from Developing Version H.02
- **Quality vs. Efficiency Trade-off:** Cheaper models lost critical analytical capabilities
- **Integration Testing Importance:** Synthesis pipeline never properly tested end-to-end
- **Datetime Robustness:** "Quick fix" made the problem worse
- **Optimizing Individual Components:** Without comprehensive integration testing led to systemic failures that outweighed efficiency gains

## Next Steps
- For the detailed plan moving from Version H.02 to the next iteration, Version H.02.5, see the **[Migration Plan for Version H.02.5](./migration.md)**.
