# Migration Retrospective: Achieving Version H.01

This document summarizes the migration from Version Type-S to Version H.01.
The primary goals for Version H.01 were set in the [Migration Plan for Version H.01 (located in ../../04.1.1-Type-S/migration.md)](../../04.1.1-Type-S/migration.md).

## Version H.01 Key Outcomes & Performance
- **Overall Verdict:** REJECT
- **Performance vs. Targets (from Type-S's Plan for H.01):**
    - p95 Latency: ~50s vs. ≤30s target - HARD FAIL
    - Tok/brief: ~8350 tokens vs. ≤7000 target - HARD FAIL
    - Cost/brief: ~$0.045 vs. ≤$0.05 target - PASS
    - Key Functional Goal: Multi-agent architecture - ACHIEVED BUT WITH CRITICAL BUG
    - Other Key Success Criteria: Format Compliance - PASS
- For full details, see the **[Version H.01 Analysis Report](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.01/analysis.md)**.

## Major Successes in Iteration H.01
- **Strong Personalization:** Excellent adaptation to different recipient profiles
- **Format Compliance:** Good adherence to specified output formats
- **Cost Efficiency:** Within target despite using more powerful models
- **Multi-Agent Foundation:** Successfully established the basic multi-agent architecture with four specialized agents

## Critical Failures & Regressions in Iteration H.01
- **Latency:** Consistently exceeded the 30s target (50.29s and 49.45s)
- **Summarizer Bug:** Consistently failed to process all news items (50% and 40%)
- **Token Usage:** Consistently exceeded the Tier 1 Hard Fail target (8,308 and 8,407 tokens vs. ≤7,000)
- **Full Item List Redundancy:** Each agent received the complete list of 10 news items regardless of relevance
- **Duplicated Persona Context:** Recipient profile information was repeated in every agent prompt
- **No Conditional Processing:** Low-relevance items received the same processing depth as high-relevance items
- **No Token Budget Enforcement:** No mechanisms to limit token usage per agent

## Key Lessons Learned from Developing Version H.01
- **Multi-Agent Potential:** The H.01 prototype successfully demonstrated the potential of a multi-agent approach, particularly in its strong personalization capabilities for diverse recipient profiles.
- **Persona Specificity:** Persona specificity improves quality but not efficiency. The Model Architect persona received more precisely tailored content with higher relevance scores for top items, but still suffered from the same architectural limitations as the Aspiring Scientist persona.
- **Prompt Efficiency:** Significant token inefficiencies were identified in the prompt design, with duplicated context and full item lists being sent to each agent.
- **Summarizer Limitations:** The Summarizer agent's failure to process all news items despite explicit instructions highlighted the need for better instruction enforcement or architectural changes.

## Next Steps
