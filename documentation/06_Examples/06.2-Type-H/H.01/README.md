# H.01: Multi-Agent Prototype

This directory contains examples of outputs from the H.01 version of our News Bot system, which represents our initial prototype of a multi-agent approach to news processing. These examples demonstrate the system's capabilities and, critically, its limitations at this early stage of development, which informed subsequent iterations.

## Key Features (Demonstrated in H.01 Outputs)

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Utilized four specialized agents working in sequence:
   - Categorizer Agent (Classified items, assigned initial scores)
   - Fact-Checker Agent (Assessed accuracy and credibility)
   - Recommender Agent (Suggested related topics and sources)
   - Summarizer Agent (Generated personalized briefings)

2. **Persona-Driven Personalization**: Agents, particularly the Summarizer, leveraged recipient profile details (interests, profession) to tailor content. For items processed, this resulted in relevant and context-aware narratives.

3. **Structured Output Format**: The Summarizer produced briefings in a consistent markdown format, typically using level-3 headings for news items.

## Examples Included

The examples showcase outputs for two distinct personas, reflecting the system's attempt to adapt to different user needs.

### [persona1.md](persona1.md): Aspiring Scientist

This example demonstrates the system's output for an aspiring scientist with broad interests spanning AI, technology, finance, and various scientific research fields. The briefing aimed to include:

- Analysis of scientific research papers (e.g., Behavioral Finance, Mathematical Logic)
- Coverage of technology industry developments (e.g., DuckDB, PDF editors)
- Personalization linking items to the recipient's diverse scientific and technical interests

While the personalization for processed items was relevant, key limitations (detailed below) impacted the overall utility of the brief.

### [persona3.md](persona3.md): Model Architect at Anthropic

This example demonstrates the system's output for a model architect at Anthropic with highly specialized interests in RLHF, constitutional AI, and alignment techniques. The briefing aimed to include:

- Coverage of cutting-edge AI research developments (e.g., IterAlign, OpenRLHF)
- Analysis tailored to AI alignment principles and the recipient's role at Anthropic

This example highlights H.01's capability for deep, domain-specific personalization for the items it managed to process. However, it also suffered from the system-wide limitations of H.01.

## Key System Limitations (Observable in H.01 Examples & Detailed in Analysis)

These examples, when reviewed alongside the main H.01 Analysis, illustrate several critical limitations of the H.01 system:

1. **Summarizer Incompleteness (Critical Functional Bug)**: The most significant issue was the Summarizer Agent's failure to process all input news items. Briefings often contained only 40-50% of the intended content, severely limiting their value (as detailed in the main analysis's "Data Loss" finding).

2. **Minimal Cross-Item Analysis**: The system had very limited ability to identify and articulate thematic connections or emergent patterns across different news items.

3. **Basic Agent Coordination & Robustness**: While agents operated in sequence, coordination was rudimentary. Failures or inefficiencies in one agent (like the Summarizer's incompleteness) were not gracefully handled, highlighting architectural weaknesses.

4. **Performance Issues**: As detailed in the H.01 Analysis, this version incurred Hard Fails on p95 Latency and Tok/brief targets, making it unsuitable for practical use.

## Relationship to Analysis

For a comprehensive technical evaluation of the H.01 system, including detailed performance metrics (latency, token usage, cost), adherence to evaluation standards (AIR, Relevance@3, etc.), and a full breakdown of its strengths and critical failures, please refer to the [H.01 Analysis](../../../05_Analysis/05.2-Type-H/H.01/analysis.md).

The examples in this directory provide concrete demonstrations of the outputs produced by the H.01 system, allowing for a qualitative assessment of the user experience and the real-world impact of the limitations quantified in the main analysis.
