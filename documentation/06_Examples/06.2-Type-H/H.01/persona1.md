2. **Assign a primary category** to each news item (e.g., Technology, Finance, Politics, Science, etc.).
3. **Rate the importance** of each news item on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is extremely important.
4. **Rate the relevance** to the recipient's interests and profession on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is extremely relevant.
5. **Provide a brief explanation** of why the news item is important or relevant to the recipient.

### OUTPUT FORMAT
For each news item, provide the following information in JSON format:
```
{
  "headline": "Original headline",
  "category": "Primary category",
  "importance": 1-5,
