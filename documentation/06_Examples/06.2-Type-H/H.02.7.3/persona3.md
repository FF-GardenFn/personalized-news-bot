Output a JSON array containing objects—no explanations, no table formats, no column headers.
CRITICAL: Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']' to be valid JSON.
CRITICAL: Every object must be wrapped with '{{' and '}}' and properly nested in the array.

Task: For each headline, include an object with these exact fields:

PaperID 1 (arXiv:2011.11688v1): An analysis of replies to Trump's tweets
   Authors: Zijian An, Kenneth Joseph
   Categories: cs.CY
   Summary: Donald Trump has tweeted thousands of times during his presidency. These public statements are an increasingly important way through which Trump communicates his political and personal views. A better understanding of the way the American public consumes and responds to these tweets is therefore critical. In the present work, we address both consum...

   Authors: Karen Zhou, Alexander A. Meitus, Milo Chase
   Categories: cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CY
   Summary: Does Donald Trump speak differently from other presidents? If so, in what ways? Are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To investigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness based on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and presents a framework for comparing th...

   Authors: Serge Galam
   Categories: physics.soc-ph
   Summary: This paper predicting Trump victory has been submitted before the election and revised after, allowing to add a Foreword and Note Added in Revision to discuss in details the causes of the failure of the prediction. In 2016, Trump was unanimously seen as the loser in the November 8 election. In contrast, using a model of opinion dynamics I have been...

   Authors: Pandya George
   Categories: cs.SI, physics.soc-ph
   Summary: Over the years, American politics have become increasingly polarized. In the current political landscape, a president cannot easily collaborate with the opposite party and pass legislature. Ideologies between parties have drifted apart to the point that one party generally stonewalls any legislature proposed by the other party. Because of this poli...

   Authors: Valerio Ficcadenti, Roy Cerqueti, Marcel Ausloos
   Categories: cs.CL
   Summary: This paper deals with a quantitative analysis of the content of official political speeches. We study a set of about one thousand talks pronounced by the US Presidents, ranging from Washington to Trump. In particular, we search for the relevance of the rare words, i.e. those said only once in each speech -- the so-called hapaxes. We implement a ran...

   Summary: In this project, the goal was to use the Julia programming language and parallelization to write a fast map reduce algorithm to count word frequencies across large numbers of documents. We first implement the word frequency counter algorithm on a CPU using two processes with MPI. Then, we create another implementation, but on a GPU using the Julia...

   Summary: Formally announced to the public following former President Donald Trump's bans and suspensions from mainstream social networks in early 2022 after his role in the January 6 Capitol Riots, Truth Social was launched as an "alternative" social media platform that claims to be a refuge for free speech, offering a platform for those disaffected by the...

   Categories: physics.soc-ph
   Summary: The Trump phenomenon is argued to depart from current populist rise in Europe. According to a model of opinion dynamics from sociophysics the machinery of Trump's amazing success obeys well-defined counter-intuitive rules. Therefore, his success was in principle predictable from the start. The model uses local majority rule arguments and obeys a th...

   Summary: Historians and researchers trust web archives to preserve social media content that no longer exists on the live web. However, what we see on the live web and how it is replayed in the archive are not always the same.

Over a period of sixty years, can we observe stylistic variations by the different French presidents of the Fifth Republic (1958-2018)? Based on official transcripts of all their...
