# Type-S.1: Baseline Summarization Model

## Overview

Type-S.1 represents our baseline single-agent summarization model, designed to transform raw news data into personalized briefings. This initial implementation focused on establishing core summarization capabilities with basic personalization features.

## Key Characteristics

- **Single-Agent Architecture**: Uses a single LLM agent to process and summarize news items
- **Basic Personalization**: Includes recipient information (name, profession, interests, location)
- **Structured Output Format**: Consistent markdown formatting with level-3 headings and sections
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes key facts, context, relevance, impact, data, and actionable takeaways

## Prompt Structure

The Type-S.1 prompt includes:

1. **Recipient Information**: Basic profile data to guide personalization
2. **News Items**: Raw news headlines and content to be summarized
3. **Instructions**: Detailed guidelines for content and formatting
4. **Style & Format**: Specific requirements for presentation

## Evaluation Results

Based on our [Standards of Evaluation](../../../02_Standards_Of_Evaluation/README.md), Type-S.1 performed as follows:

1. **Summarization Fidelity**: ★★★ (Strong)
   - Outputs cover key facts, broader context, personalized relevance, quantitative data, and actionable takeaways for each news item
   - Manual inspection suggests comprehensive coverage with minimal hallucination

2. **Semantic Cohesion & Coherence**: ★★★ (Strong)
   - Uses clear markdown headings and short paragraphs
   - Logical flow maintained across all items

3. **Tone & Style Consistency**: ★★ (Moderate)
   - Consistent expert, second-person tone as instructed
   - Appropriate use of formatting elements

4. **Personalization Accuracy**: ★ (Basic)
   - Includes generic "Relevance to You" links to recipient interests
   - Lacks deeper persona adaptation (no personalized greeting or domain-specific framing)

5. **Efficiency & Cost**: ★★★ (Strong)
   - Single-agent design with efficient token usage (approx. 2,000 tokens total for persona1)
   - No multi-agent overhead

6. **Structural & Format Validity**: ★★★ (Strong)
   - Valid markdown structure suitable for email distribution
   - Proper use of level-3 headings and list elements

7. **Readability & Accessibility**: ★★★ (Strong)
   - Short, digestible paragraphs; easy to scan
   - All content is text-only, ensuring broad compatibility

8. **Human Evaluation**: ★★ (Moderate, presumed)
   - Not formally collected for this iteration

## Limitations

Type-S.1 had several limitations that were addressed in subsequent versions:

1. **Shallow Personalization**: While content was linked to recipient interests, it lacked deeper professional context
2. **Generic Tone**: The summarization style was consistent but not tailored to the recipient's professional domain
3. **Limited Engagement**: No persona-based framing to establish rapport with the recipient
4. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Lacked field-specific language that would resonate with professionals

## Example Output

**See [persona1.md](persona1.md) for a complete example of Type-S.1 output.**

**See [persona3.md](persona3.md) for a complete example of Type-S.1 output.**

## Conclusion

Type-S.1 established a solid foundation for our news summarization system, demonstrating strong capabilities in content coverage, structure, and basic personalization. However, its limitations in deeper personalization and professional relevance led to the development of Type-S.2, which introduced enhanced persona adaptation features.
